This is a 4 week Bootcamp Final Project that is a Matching Game: When the game starts, five smiley faces are shown on the left and four are shown on the right. The left and right sides are identical, except for one thing: the left side has one extra face. The user needs to click on that extra face. If anything except the correct face is clicked, a message is displayed saying that the game is over. If the correct face is clicked, all the currently displayed faces are removed and a new set of faces is shown at random positions.  Each time a new set of faces is shown there will be 5 more faces than before, on both the left and the right sides. There will always be one more face shown on the left than on the right. The other faces on the right and left will be identical in position to each other.
